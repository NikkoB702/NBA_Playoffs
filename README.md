## NBA Team Performance Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the number of wins ('W') for NBA teams based on their statistics. The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of various team-level features, such as shooting percentages, turnovers, and attendance.

##### Model Performance

The model was trained using a linear regression algorithm and evaluated on a test dataset. The performance metric used for evaluation is Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values for the target variable ('W').

The model achieved an MSE of 3.575048502907954e-08 on the test dataset, indicating that the predictions are close to the actual values. However, it's essential to evaluate the model on various performance metrics and validate its performance using techniques like cross-validation to ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

##### Repository Structure
